# Rag-Intro

This Python application leverages OpenAI's API and Chroma for document embedding and querying. The application loads text documents from a specified directory, splits them into chunks, generates embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model, and stores them in a Chroma collection. It then allows querying the documents to find relevant chunks based on a given question.
